	abstract = {MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is a new streaming standard that has been recently ratified as an international standard (IS). In comparison to other streaming systems, e.g., HTTP progressive download, DASH is able to handle varying bandwidth conditions providing smooth streaming. Furthermore, it enables NAT and Firewall traversal, flexible and scalable deployment as well as reduced infrastructure costs due to the reuse of existing Internet infrastructure components, e.g., proxies, caches, and Content Distribution Networks (CDN). Recently, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Bis (httpbis) working group of the IETF has officially started the development of HTTP 2.0. Initially three major proposals have been submitted to the IETF i.e., Googles' SPDY, Microsofts' HTTP Speed+Mobility and Network-Friendly HTTP Upgrade, but SPDY has been chosen as working draft for HTTP 2.0. In this paper we implemented MPEG-DASH over HTTP 2.0 (i.e., SPDY), demonstrating its potential benefits and drawbacks. Moreover, several experimental evaluations have been performed that compare HTTP 2.0 with HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 1.0 in the context of DASH. In particular, the protocol overhead, the performance for different round trip times, and DASH with HTTP 2.0 in a lab test scenario has been evaluated in detail.},

Many papers cover this topic and present their research results, but unfortunately all of them use their own private dataset which -- in most cases -- is not publicly available. Hence, it is difficult to compare, e.g., adaptation algorithms in an objective way due to the lack of a common dataset which shall be used as basis for such experiments. In this paper, we present our DASH dataset including our DASHEncoder, an open source DASH content generation tool. We also provide basic evaluations of the different segment lengths, the influence of HTTP server settings, and, in this context, we show some of the advantages as well as problems of shorter segment lengths.},

	abstract = {In this survey, we present state-of-the-art bitrate adaptation algorithms for HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS). As a key distinction from other streaming approaches, the bitrate adaptation algorithms in HAS are chiefly executed at each client, i.e., in a distributed manner. The objective of these algorithms is to ensure a high quality of experience (QoE) for viewers in the presence of bandwidth fluctuations due to factors like signal strength, network congestion, network reconvergence events, etc. While such fluctuations are common in public Internet, they can also occur in home networksor even managed networks where there is often admission control and QoS tools. Bitrate adaptation algorithms may take factors like bandwidth estimations, playback buffer fullness, device features, viewer preferences, and content features into account, albeit with different weights. Since the viewer's QoE needs to be determined in real-time during playback, objective metrics are generally used including number of buffer stalls, duration of startup delay, frequency and amount of quality oscillations, and video instability. By design, the standards for HAS do not mandate any particular adaptation algorithm, leaving it to system builders to innovate and implement their own method. This survey provides an overview of the different methods proposed over the last several years.},

	abstract = {Nearly three-fourths of the world's mobile data traffic will be video in the next 5 years. Video is one of the most demanding services in terms of network efficiency, reliability, and quality. In this work, we present a comparative performance evaluation of three different video streaming protocols, namely MPEG-DASH, RTSP, and RTMP for both on-demand and live video streaming over 4G and Wi-Fi (under different network conditions) in terms of Quality of user Experience (QoE). QoE measurements have been done (i) applying the recently standardized ITU-T Rec P-1201.1, which specifies the model algorithm for non-intrusive monitoring of video quality of IP-based video services based on packet header information for the lower resolution application area, and (ii) an extended non-standardized parametric model for comparative purposes. Results suggest that RTSP is more efficient than MPEG DASH for starting the video playback, but at the expense of decreasing QoE due to packet losses. We have also detected that PLR has a bigger influence over re-buffering events than end-to-end delay both in 4G/LTE and Wi-Fi, and that a slightly best quality is achieved by using QPSK at 20 MHz in 4G/LTE. QoE is noticeably higher with MPEG DASH than that attained by using RTSP, but slightly worse than that obtained with RTMP. Finally, our findings suggest that the use of parametric models for video QoE evaluation should be carefully review in terms of the weight that packet losses should have when streaming protocols based on reliable transport protocols (e.g., TCP) are used.},

	doi = {10.1109/QoMEX.2015.7148117},
	abstract = {MPEG-DASH has become one of the mainstream methods for streaming video over un-managed networks, as it enables users to receive this video at the best possible QoE level the network capacity and the users' terminals capabilities allow. However, it has been observed that when MPEG-DASH users, sharing the same access network, request, in parallel, the offered video content, QoE unfairness occurs: some users receive video content that corresponds to a high QoE level whereas all others do not. As a reason for this result, literature points out the inter-dynamics between TCP's congestion avoidance mechanism and the on-off operational pattern of MPEG-DASH switching logic. In this paper, we try to shed some more light on this QoE unfairness issue by investigating how the segment duration of the video content can effect the MPEG-DASH users' QoE level. Towards this, we designed a number of experiments where two identical users request, concurrently, the same video service, but utilising a different segment duration. As this work is part of a larger effort regarding MPEG-DASH, QoE and interactive digital broadcasting, we conducted our experiments over an interactive DVB-T testbed. The experimental results show a strong correlation between the video's segment duration and the MPEG-DASH users QoE level: the user utilising a longer segment duration achieves a higher QoE level than the one utilising a shorter segment duration.},

	abstract = {Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is an ISO/IEC MPEG standard which enables the convenient and smooth transportation of multimedia data to heterogeneous end devices over networks with variable bandwidth conditions. This kind of streaming technology is mainly used with HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 respectively, which both have some drawbacks. Therefore, the IETF has started the development of HTTP 2.0, which is based on Google's SPDY proposal and already supported by several major companies, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Akamai, Mozilla and obviously Google. Furthermore, Content Centric Networking (CCN) is another novel approach for future networks that is considered as an revolutionary approach compared to HTTP 2.0. The CCN communication paradigm is completely different and does not rely on direct connections between hosts, it rather focuses on the content. This paper demonstrates DASH with HTTP 2.0/SPDY and CCN using our universal libdash library. Moreover, different mechanisms of DASH will be shown that can be used to provide on-demand and live content in an efficient and comfortable way.},

	abstract = {HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is becoming the de facto standard for Over-The-Top (OTT)-based video streaming services such as YouTube and Netflix. By splitting a video into multiple segments of a couple of seconds and encoding each of these at multiple quality levels, HAS allows a video client to dynamically adapt the requested quality during the playout to react to network changes. However, state-of-the-art quality selection heuristics are deterministic and tailored to specific network configurations. Therefore, they are unable to cope with a vast range of highly dynamic network settings. In this letter, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based HAS client is presented and evaluated. The self-learning HAS client dynamically adapts its behaviour by interacting with the environment to optimize the Quality of Experience (QoE), the quality as perceived by the end-user. The proposed client has been thoroughly evaluated using a network-based simulator and is shown to outperform traditional HAS clients by up to 13\% in a mobile network environment.},

	abstract = {Changing network conditions pose severe problems to video streaming in the Internet. HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) is a technology employed by numerous video services that relieves these issues by adapting the video to the current network conditions. It enables service providers to improve resource utilization and Quality of Experience (QoE) by incorporating information from different layers in order to deliver and adapt a video in its best possible quality. Thereby, it allows taking into account end user device capabilities, available video quality levels, current network conditions, and current server load. For end users, the major benefits of HAS compared to classical HTTP video streaming are reduced interruptions of the video playback and higher bandwidth utilization, which both generally result in a higher QoE. Adaptation is possible by changing the frame rate, resolution, or quantization of the video, which can be done with various adaptation strategies and related client- and server-side actions. The technical development of HAS, existing open standardized solutions, but also proprietary solutions are reviewed in this paper as fundamental to derive the QoE influence factors that emerge as a result of adaptation. The main contribution is a comprehensive survey of QoE related works from human computer interaction and networking domains, which are structured according to the QoE impact of video adaptation. To be more precise, subjective studies that cover QoE aspects of adaptation dimensions and strategies are revisited. As a result, QoE influence factors of HAS and corresponding QoE models are identified, but also open issues and conflicting results are discussed. Furthermore, technical influence factors, which are often ignored in the context of HAS, affect perceptual QoE influence factors and are consequently analyzed. This survey gives the reader an overview of the current state of the art and recent developments. At the same time, it targets networking researchers who develop new solutions for HTTP video streaming or assess video streaming from a user centric point of view. Therefore, this paper is a major step toward truly improving HAS.},

	url = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00977812},
	abstract = {This White Paper is a contribution of the European Network on Quality of Experience in Multimedia Systems and Services, Qualinet (COST Action IC 1003, see www.qualinet.eu), to the scientific discussion about the term "Quality of Experience" (QoE) and its underlying concepts. It resulted from the need to agree on a working definition for this term which facilitates the communication of ideas within a multidisciplinary group, where a joint interest around multimedia communication systems exists, however approached from different perspectives. Thus, the concepts and ideas cited in this paper mainly refer to the Quality of Experience of multimedia communication systems, but may be helpful also for other areas where QoE is an issue. The Network of Excellence (NoE) Qualinet aims at extending the notion of network-centric Quality of Service (QoS) in multimedia systems, by relying on the concept of Quality of Experience (QoE). The main scientific objective is the development of methodologies for subjective and objective quality metrics taking into account current and new trends in multimedia communication systems as witnessed by the appearance of new types of content and interactions. A substantial scientific impact on fragmented efforts carried out in this field will be achieved by coordinating the research of European experts under the catalytic COST umbrella. The White Paper has been compiled on the basis of a first open call for ideas which was launched for the February 2012 Qualinet Meeting held in Prague, Czech Republic. The ideas were presented as short statements during that meeting, reflecting the ideas of the persons listed under the headline "Contributors" in the previous section. During the Prague meeting, the ideas have been further discussed and consolidated in the form of a general structure of the present document. An open call for authors was issued at that meeting, to which the persons listed as "Authors" in the previous section have announced their willingness to contribute in the preparation of individual sections. For each section, a coordinating author has been assigned which coordinated the writing of that section, and which is underlined in the author list preceding each section. The individual sections were then integrated and aligned by an editing group (listed as "Editors" in the previous section), and the entire document was iterated with the entire group of authors. Furthermore, the draft text was discussed with the participants of the Dagstuhl Seminar 12181 "Quality of Experience: From User Perception to Instrumental Metrics" which was held in Schloß Dagstuhl, Germany, May 1-4 2012, and a number of changes were proposed, resulting in the present document. As a result of the writing process and the large number of contributors, authors and editors, the document will not reflect the opinion of each individual person at all points. Still, we hope that it is found to be useful for everybody working in the field of Quality of Experience of multimedia communication systems, and most probably also beyond that field.},

In this technique, the streaming bit-rate is constantly adjusted in accordance to the variations in the underlying network bandwidth conditions. A popular instantiation of this approach is to extend traditional HTTP-based streaming. While several such implementations are widely available, it is unclear how they perform under a typical high-speed vehicular environment, wherein the wireless bandwidth varies significantly and rapidly. In this paper, we seek to provide some insights on this issue through empirical experiments driven by real-world wireless bandwidth traces collected from moving vehicles. Our results suggest that, with appropriate parameter configurations, HTTP adaptive streaming is an effective solution for delivering a high-quality smooth streaming experience even under high-speed vehicular mobility.},

	abstract = {Attempting to cope with fluctuations of network conditions in terms of available bandwidth, latency and packet loss, and to deliver the highest quality of video (and audio) content to users, research on adaptive video streaming has attracted intense efforts from the research community and huge investments from technology giants. How successful these efforts and investments are, is a question that needs precise measurements of the results of those technological advancements. HTTP-based Adaptive Streaming (HAS) algorithms, which seek to improve video streaming over the Internet, introduce video bitrate adaptivity in a way that is scalable and efficient. However, how each HAS implementation takes into account the wide spectrum of variables and configuration options, brings a high complexity to the task of measuring the results and visualizing the statistics of the performance and quality of experience. In this paper, we introduce CAdViSE, our Cloud-based Adaptive Video Streaming Evaluation framework for the automated testing of adaptive media players. The paper aims to demonstrate a test environment which can be instantiated in a cloud infrastructure, examines multiple media players with different network attributes at defined points of the experiment time, and finally concludes the evaluation with visualized statistics and insights into the results.},

DASH is an emerging ISO/IEC MPEG and 3GPP standard for HTTP streaming. It aims to standardize formats enabling segmented progressive download by exploiting existing Internet infrastructure as such. Our implementation of these formats as described in this paper is based on the well-known VLC. Hence, it is fully integrated into the VLC structure and has been also submitted to the VLC development team for consideration in future releases of VLC. Therefore, it is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The plugin provides a very flexible structure that could be easily extended with respect to different adaptation logics or profiles of the DASH standard. As a consequence, the plugin enables the integration of a variety of adaptation logics and comparison thereof, making it attractive for the research community.},
