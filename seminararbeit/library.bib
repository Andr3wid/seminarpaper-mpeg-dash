	abstract = {MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is a new streaming standard that has been recently ratified as an international standard (IS). In comparison to other streaming systems, e.g., HTTP progressive download, DASH is able to handle varying bandwidth conditions providing smooth streaming. Furthermore, it enables NAT and Firewall traversal, flexible and scalable deployment as well as reduced infrastructure costs due to the reuse of existing Internet infrastructure components, e.g., proxies, caches, and Content Distribution Networks (CDN). Recently, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Bis (httpbis) working group of the IETF has officially started the development of HTTP 2.0. Initially three major proposals have been submitted to the IETF i.e., Googles' SPDY, Microsofts' HTTP Speed+Mobility and Network-Friendly HTTP Upgrade, but SPDY has been chosen as working draft for HTTP 2.0. In this paper we implemented MPEG-DASH over HTTP 2.0 (i.e., SPDY), demonstrating its potential benefits and drawbacks. Moreover, several experimental evaluations have been performed that compare HTTP 2.0 with HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 1.0 in the context of DASH. In particular, the protocol overhead, the performance for different round trip times, and DASH with HTTP 2.0 in a lab test scenario has been evaluated in detail.},

Many papers cover this topic and present their research results, but unfortunately all of them use their own private dataset which -- in most cases -- is not publicly available. Hence, it is difficult to compare, e.g., adaptation algorithms in an objective way due to the lack of a common dataset which shall be used as basis for such experiments. In this paper, we present our DASH dataset including our DASHEncoder, an open source DASH content generation tool. We also provide basic evaluations of the different segment lengths, the influence of HTTP server settings, and, in this context, we show some of the advantages as well as problems of shorter segment lengths.},

	abstract = {In this survey, we present state-of-the-art bitrate adaptation algorithms for HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS). As a key distinction from other streaming approaches, the bitrate adaptation algorithms in HAS are chiefly executed at each client, i.e., in a distributed manner. The objective of these algorithms is to ensure a high quality of experience (QoE) for viewers in the presence of bandwidth fluctuations due to factors like signal strength, network congestion, network reconvergence events, etc. While such fluctuations are common in public Internet, they can also occur in home networksor even managed networks where there is often admission control and QoS tools. Bitrate adaptation algorithms may take factors like bandwidth estimations, playback buffer fullness, device features, viewer preferences, and content features into account, albeit with different weights. Since the viewer's QoE needs to be determined in real-time during playback, objective metrics are generally used including number of buffer stalls, duration of startup delay, frequency and amount of quality oscillations, and video instability. By design, the standards for HAS do not mandate any particular adaptation algorithm, leaving it to system builders to innovate and implement their own method. This survey provides an overview of the different methods proposed over the last several years.},

	abstract = {Nearly three-fourths of the world's mobile data traffic will be video in the next 5 years. Video is one of the most demanding services in terms of network efficiency, reliability, and quality. In this work, we present a comparative performance evaluation of three different video streaming protocols, namely MPEG-DASH, RTSP, and RTMP for both on-demand and live video streaming over 4G and Wi-Fi (under different network conditions) in terms of Quality of user Experience (QoE). QoE measurements have been done (i) applying the recently standardized ITU-T Rec P-1201.1, which specifies the model algorithm for non-intrusive monitoring of video quality of IP-based video services based on packet header information for the lower resolution application area, and (ii) an extended non-standardized parametric model for comparative purposes. Results suggest that RTSP is more efficient than MPEG DASH for starting the video playback, but at the expense of decreasing QoE due to packet losses. We have also detected that PLR has a bigger influence over re-buffering events than end-to-end delay both in 4G/LTE and Wi-Fi, and that a slightly best quality is achieved by using QPSK at 20 MHz in 4G/LTE. QoE is noticeably higher with MPEG DASH than that attained by using RTSP, but slightly worse than that obtained with RTMP. Finally, our findings suggest that the use of parametric models for video QoE evaluation should be carefully review in terms of the weight that packet losses should have when streaming protocols based on reliable transport protocols (e.g., TCP) are used.},

	doi = {10.1109/QoMEX.2015.7148117},
	abstract = {MPEG-DASH has become one of the mainstream methods for streaming video over un-managed networks, as it enables users to receive this video at the best possible QoE level the network capacity and the users' terminals capabilities allow. However, it has been observed that when MPEG-DASH users, sharing the same access network, request, in parallel, the offered video content, QoE unfairness occurs: some users receive video content that corresponds to a high QoE level whereas all others do not. As a reason for this result, literature points out the inter-dynamics between TCP's congestion avoidance mechanism and the on-off operational pattern of MPEG-DASH switching logic. In this paper, we try to shed some more light on this QoE unfairness issue by investigating how the segment duration of the video content can effect the MPEG-DASH users' QoE level. Towards this, we designed a number of experiments where two identical users request, concurrently, the same video service, but utilising a different segment duration. As this work is part of a larger effort regarding MPEG-DASH, QoE and interactive digital broadcasting, we conducted our experiments over an interactive DVB-T testbed. The experimental results show a strong correlation between the video's segment duration and the MPEG-DASH users QoE level: the user utilising a longer segment duration achieves a higher QoE level than the one utilising a shorter segment duration.},

	abstract = {Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is an ISO/IEC MPEG standard which enables the convenient and smooth transportation of multimedia data to heterogeneous end devices over networks with variable bandwidth conditions. This kind of streaming technology is mainly used with HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 respectively, which both have some drawbacks. Therefore, the IETF has started the development of HTTP 2.0, which is based on Google's SPDY proposal and already supported by several major companies, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Akamai, Mozilla and obviously Google. Furthermore, Content Centric Networking (CCN) is another novel approach for future networks that is considered as an revolutionary approach compared to HTTP 2.0. The CCN communication paradigm is completely different and does not rely on direct connections between hosts, it rather focuses on the content. This paper demonstrates DASH with HTTP 2.0/SPDY and CCN using our universal libdash library. Moreover, different mechanisms of DASH will be shown that can be used to provide on-demand and live content in an efficient and comfortable way.},

	abstract = {HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is becoming the de facto standard for Over-The-Top (OTT)-based video streaming services such as YouTube and Netflix. By splitting a video into multiple segments of a couple of seconds and encoding each of these at multiple quality levels, HAS allows a video client to dynamically adapt the requested quality during the playout to react to network changes. However, state-of-the-art quality selection heuristics are deterministic and tailored to specific network configurations. Therefore, they are unable to cope with a vast range of highly dynamic network settings. In this letter, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based HAS client is presented and evaluated. The self-learning HAS client dynamically adapts its behaviour by interacting with the environment to optimize the Quality of Experience (QoE), the quality as perceived by the end-user. The proposed client has been thoroughly evaluated using a network-based simulator and is shown to outperform traditional HAS clients by up to 13\% in a mobile network environment.},
