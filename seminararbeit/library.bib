	abstract = {{MPEG} Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over {HTTP} ({DASH}) is a new streaming standard that has been recently ratified as an international standard ({IS}). In comparison to other streaming systems, e.g., {HTTP} progressive download, {DASH} is able to handle varying bandwidth conditions providing smooth streaming. Furthermore, it enables {NAT} and Firewall traversal, flexible and scalable deployment as well as reduced infrastructure costs due to the reuse of existing Internet infrastructure components, e.g., proxies, caches, and Content Distribution Networks ({CDN}). Recently, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Bis (httpbis) working group of the {IETF} has officially started the development of {HTTP} 2.0. Initially three major proposals have been submitted to the {IETF} i.e., Googles' {SPDY}, Microsofts' {HTTP} Speed+Mobility and Network-Friendly {HTTP} Upgrade, but {SPDY} has been chosen as working draft for {HTTP} 2.0. In this paper we implemented {MPEG}-{DASH} over {HTTP} 2.0 (i.e., {SPDY}), demonstrating its potential benefits and drawbacks. Moreover, several experimental evaluations have been performed that compare {HTTP} 2.0 with {HTTP} 1.1 and {HTTP} 1.0 in the context of {DASH}. In particular, the protocol overhead, the performance for different round trip times, and {DASH} with {HTTP} 2.0 in a lab test scenario has been evaluated in detail.},

	abstract = {The delivery of audio-visual content over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ({HTTP}) got lot of attention in recent years and with dynamic adaptive streaming over {HTTP} ({DASH}) a standard is now available. Many papers cover this topic and present their research results, but unfortunately all of them use their own private dataset which -- in most cases -- is not publicly available. Hence, it is difficult to compare, e.g., adaptation algorithms in an objective way due to the lack of a common dataset which shall be used as basis for such experiments. In this paper, we present our {DASH} dataset including our {DASHEncoder}, an open source {DASH} content generation tool. We also provide basic evaluations of the different segment lengths, the influence of {HTTP} server settings, and, in this context, we show some of the advantages as well as problems of shorter segment lengths.},

	doi = {10.1109/COMST.2018.2862938},
	abstract = {In this survey, we present state-of-the-art bitrate adaptation algorithms for {HTTP} adaptive streaming ({HAS}). As a key distinction from other streaming approaches, the bitrate adaptation algorithms in {HAS} are chiefly executed at each client, i.e., in a distributed manner. The objective of these algorithms is to ensure a high quality of experience ({QoE}) for viewers in the presence of bandwidth fluctuations due to factors like signal strength, network congestion, network reconvergence events, etc. While such fluctuations are common in public Internet, they can also occur in home networksor even managed networks where there is often admission control and {QoS} tools. Bitrate adaptation algorithms may take factors like bandwidth estimations, playback buffer fullness, device features, viewer preferences, and content features into account, albeit with different weights. Since the viewer's {QoE} needs to be determined in real-time during playback, objective metrics are generally used including number of buffer stalls, duration of startup delay, frequency and amount of quality oscillations, and video instability. By design, the standards for {HAS} do not mandate any particular adaptation algorithm, leaving it to system builders to innovate and implement their own method. This survey provides an overview of the different methods proposed over the last several years.},

Therefore, aspects of {CDNs} in terms of basics, design process, practice, techniques, performances, platforms, applications, and experimental results have been presented in a proper order. Fundamental methods, initiatives, significant research results, as well as references for further study have also been provided. Comparison of different design and development approaches are described at the appropriate places so that new researchers as well as advanced practitioners can use the {CDNs} evaluation as a research roadmap. All the contributions have been reviewed, edited, processed, and placed in the appropriate order to maintain consistency so that any reader irrespective of their level of knowledge and technological skills in {CDNs} would get the most out of it. The book is organized into three parts, namely, Part I: {CDN} Fundamentals; Part {II}: {CDN} Modeling and Performance; and Part {III}: Advanced {CDN} Platforms and Applications. The organization ensures the smooth flow of material as successive chapters build on prior ones.},
